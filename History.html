                    The Origin of Cocktails
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Cocktail making is the practice of mixing spirits and liquers with non-alcoholic foorstuffs, typically such as fruit juices or creams. The culture surrounding the cocktail bar experience derives from America's prohibion era 'speakeasies'; so called for the comfort and safety such illicit venues offered their clientele at time where imbibing was outlawed. Much alcohol available at this time was of desperate quality, made by improper means, as professional breweries and distilleries were closed for business. One particular phrase for these homebrews persists today; 'bathtub gin'. Because of the low quality nature of these drinks there was a neccesity to hide the harsh, unpalatable, liquids inside sweet drinks. The collection and refinement of such 'cocktails' are now known as the 'classics' of all cocktail menus, distinct from the 'tiki' collection of cocktails from the southern hemisphere, or modern classics, like the Pornstar Martini and Aperol Spritz.
