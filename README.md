    This site is an encyclopedia of cocktail recipes, designed to be easily made at home.
    There is an increasing trend of consumers drinking at home because of factors such as the global pandemic, and now inflation.
    This site aims to make cocktail making accessible and simplified for the sitting room sipper.

### Wireframes

## Testing
    1. Previewed site in browser with command "python3 -m "http.server""
        History page had cocktails written in red as per stylesheet.
    2. Added CSS rules to nav element, did not effect ul. Applying id to ul instead.
    3. Changed css identifier to # to target id. Color of bulleit points changed.
    4. New day, success! Issue with navbar-list was style rule 'display: flex;'.
    5. More success! Couldn't colour list items, class had to be inside anchor not li.
